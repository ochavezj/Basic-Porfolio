					A lefty who thinks he's right.<br>
					<br>
					I'm a work in progess, currently recrating myself. My creative passion was previously stomped out and became as elusive as Big Foot or the Lochness Monster: spotted briefly,but quickly discredited and disgarded by skpetics and society. It wasn't until Google, Facebook and even Myspace (sorry) became household names that I thought there might be something to this. Little did I know that "coding" thing everyone was talking about was actually what I had been picking up from friends and websites to design my Myspace profile (seriously, stop judging me! It was Cool!) this HTML was like magic to me!<br>
					<br>
					Sidenote: did anyone else think HTML was an abbreviation for "Hot Mail"? Did anyone use that? I mean seriously...but I digress<br>
					<br>
					An abilty to create digitally seemed to even the playing field (especislly for us lefties) there were no spiral notbooks to dig into your wrist, no smearign your words or drawings with your had as you passed left to right. A keyboard made everything fair and that was awesome!<br>
